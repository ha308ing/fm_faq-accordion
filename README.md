## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript

### What I learned

- Checkbox toggle isn't triggerred on label with keyboard event when input is hidden (unlike with mouse event)
- - `<dl>` - description list
  - `<dt>` - title/term
  - `<dd>` - description itself
- css `outline-color` doesn't work without `outline-style: solid` in firefox
